            <h1>Channel Rules, Guidelines, &amp; Resources</h1>
            <p>The #dogecoin IRC channel is a public chat room on the internet that anyone can join from all over the world. As such, there are many users, of every age, who speak many languages and follow many differing customs from your own. It is always safer to ask for clarification of context than to blindly assume understanding of any ambiguous statements.</p>
            <p>We aim to keep the channel a friendly place for everyone and ensure the channel is welcoming for newcomers. So, don't be shy! Feel free to contribute to the channel discussion and help users out. Don't be scared to offer a new topic of discussion either. Please go out of your way to welcome new members, and help each other when misunderstandings may occur. We like to have fun and respect each other at all times, no matter what differences may arise.</p>
            <p>Our wonderful team of channel operators are usually available to help you with any problems that may arise. Please feel free to PM (private-message) us at any time. Keep in mind though, if one of us is sleeping, we may not answer! You can also call our attention to the channel by simply typing our name into the chat. If you urgently require an operator, due to someone misbehaving, or otherwise, just say "!ops" and the channel operators will be notified. This should only be used in severe circumstances and abuse will not be tolerated. Under all other circumstances, you can use "!noteops" to send a message to the operators.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that profanity and vulgarity may occur at times, but we ask that you try to be respectful and friendly towards other users. The chat room is not guaranteed SFW (safe-for-work), so please keep this in mind when actively using it. Please also be aware that this IRC channel is logged and that these logs are accessible in the public domain. Do not say things that you would be uncomfortable having made in-public.</p>

            <h2 id="rules">Unacceptable Activities</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Illegal activities (including discussion)</strong> pursuant to Freenode's policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Scamming</strong>, including that which does not involve members of the channel or Dogecoin.</li>
                <li><strong>Impersonation.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Spamming and/or flooding.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Operating malicious bots/scripts.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Being active for the sole purpose of receiving soaks</strong> (or using a script to keep yourself active, see rule 5).</li>
                <li><strong>Simultaneously using multiple clients</strong>, also known as having clones.</li>
                <li><strong>Posting malicious or referral links</strong> (e.g. links to sites attempting to steal personal information, money, install malicious software on a userâ€™s computer, etc).</li>
                <li><strong>Continually purveying misinformation</strong> despite warning(s).</li>
                <li><strong>Publishing or sharing personal information of others</strong> (without permission), also known as &ldquo;doxing&rdquo;.</li>
                <li><strong>Promotion of market-manipulation </strong>or &ldquo;pump &amp; dump&rdquo; schemes.</li>
                <li><strong>Unconstructive/excessive promotion</strong> of other alternative cryptocurrencies, any products, websites, etc., also known as &ldquo;shilling&rdquo;. Note the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;, as you can talk about all of the aforementioned items.</li>
                <li><strong>Continual advertising/promotion </strong>despite warning(s).</li>
                <li><strong>Posting pornographic or highly inapprorpiate/explicit content.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Hate speech/Derogatory terms.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Personally attacking others.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Flame wars.</strong> Flaming is the act of sending messages that are deliberately hostile and insulting.</li>
                <li><strong>Inappropriate usage of the !ops command.</strong> This should only be used for emergencies. Please use !noteops to leave the operators a message.</li>
				<li><strong>Continual trolling</strong> despite warning(s).</li>
                <li><strong>Excessive use of profanity, vulgarity or sexual terms</strong> despite warning(s).</li>
                <li><strong>Starting or participating in discussions to incite drama or negativity.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Backset moderating/"mini modding".</strong> In some cases it would be appropriate to warn users for breaking rules - e.g. when operators are afk.</li>
                <li><strong>Begging. </strong>Please take this to #dogecoin-beg.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring operators </strong>This rule acts as a guideline and will not be directly enforced with consequences, but if you willingly choose to ignore an operator (usually with /ignore), you cannot complain you were not warned prior to receiving a punishment.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <hr />
            
            <p>One of the most important principles we encourage is to be courteous to others. Though respect is earned, it must start somewhere. Respect someone's right for their own opinion and if you respond, acknowledge that they do deserve a measure of politeness in your response. Sometimes there will be conflicts that arise when people voice opinions, but be courteous when disagreeing or challenging others. It is possible to disagree without being insulting. If at anytime you wish to "block" a user, you can ignore them by using the /ignore &lt;nickname&gt; command, replacing &lt;nickname&gt; with the user's nickname (if your IRC client supports it).</p>
            <p>Remember, we all get things wrong occasionally. We should admit the possibility of fault and respect different point of views. Similarly, while something could seem perfectly obvious to you, others may see it differently. If you screw up, take responsibility for your actions.</p>
            <p>Whilst we support free speech, along with Freenode, we cannot allow absolute free speech. Some discussions and activities can be inappropriate and disruptive for the IRC channel. It is important keep the channel friendly, especially for newcomers. Generally, anything that would make a newcomer feel unwelcome or would reflect badly on the Dogecoin community is usually to be avoided.</p>
            <p>Sometimes discussions (which are usually controversial) can escalate out of control resulting in fighting or a discussion which is unfriendly for users, if this occurs then the channel operators may need to step in to resolve things. Please be aware and drop a discussion if you are asked. Please also respect the fact that these discussions can be taken elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Occasionally we may miss out on issues or situations which have occurred. If you perceive a breach of rules or something potentially inappropriate, then feel free to inform us by reporting any abuse and we will investigate.</p>
            <p>Please respect an operator's decision and if you wish to challenge or question an operator please take this to a PM (private message). There is no need to question this within the channel or cause additional fuss. If you believe an operator has behaved inappropriately or abused privileges, please report this abuse, preferably soon after the incident, using the correct methods. Be sure to clearly state you wish to "Report an incident".</p>
            <p>Remember that these guidelines are not exhaustive. Please use common sense when using the #dogecoin IRC channel.</p>

            <h2 id="botpolicy">Bot Policy</h2>
            <p>We do allow some bots/scripts in #dogecoin, as long as they are not malicious or interact with the channel and/or other users. You can contact us if you wish to obtain permission for bots by joining #dogecoin-bots. Due the the high volume of #dogecoin chat traffic, we are unfortunately unable to approve every bot request made. Text in yellow has recently been modified.</p>

                        <li>If a user types "!help foo" and your bot does not have a !foo command, it should not say anything.</li>

                        <li>You are free to implement soaking functionality in your bot but only one soaker should be present at a time so you may only enable it in case other soakers aren't working. You are not allowed to block a user from being soaked without permission from the channel operators.</li>

            <h2 id="register">Registering on IRC</h2>
            <p>Registering your nickname on IRC opens the door to various IRC network-wide services, such as NickServ and ChanServ. It also helps users correctly identify you, reducing the risk of impersonation. Additionally, you will be unable to use the Doger tipbot unless you have a registered nickname. For more info refer to <a href="http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#registering" target="_blank">http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#registering</a></p>
            <p>To register your nickname use this command: <strong>/msg NickServ register PASSWORD EMAIL</strong></p>
            <p>Where <strong>PASSWORD</strong> and <strong>EMAIL</strong> are replaced with your desired password and email address.</p>
            <p>Later, after you verify your email address, you can identify to your account using this command: <strong>/msg NickServ identify PASSWORD</strong></p>
            <p>For more information regarding nickname registration refer to <a href="http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup" target="_blank">http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup</a></p>
